    <h1>Operational Security (OPSEC) Principles</h1>
    <p>At Hermetrix Technologies, our OPSEC consulting is guided by core principles that reinforce security at every level beyond technology.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know What You’re Protecting:</strong> Understand the critical assets including human, informational, and physical elements.</li>
      <li><strong>Know Your Adversaries:</strong> Analyze potential threat actors – their motivations, capabilities, and intent.</li>
      <li><strong>Identify Vulnerabilities:</strong> Evaluate weaknesses across people, processes, and technology.</li>
      <li><strong>Control Your Digital Footprint:</strong> Map and limit the attack surface created by digital exposures.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer Security Defenses:</strong> Employ a “Mosaic Effect” approach ensuring no single failure compromises overall security.</li>
      <li><strong>Enable and Empower People:</strong> Establish training, protocols and continuous improvement programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Adaptation:</strong> Maintain vigilance and evolve defenses as threats and environments change.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our methodology ensures strategic risk mitigation through intelligence-driven and practical OPSEC measures.</p>
