# Brutalist Redesign Plan for Hermetrix Website

## Objectives:
- Implement authoritative, brutalist, and professional aesthetic on all pages
- Use high-contrast black and white palette inspired by matrix.org
- Incorporate layout and UI element inspirations from ubs.com
- Add new page for OPSEC Principles and any other relevant pages
- Full freedom to add, modify, or delete existing content and styles.

## Tasks:

1. Global Styles
   - Overhaul src/styles/global.css with brutalist colors (black, white, minimal greys)
   - Change typography to strong sans-serif or monospaced fonts with large, clear headings
   - Remove gradients, soft shadows; emphasize strong lines and blocks
   - Define brutish button styles, links, and interactive elements

2. Layout and Components
   - Redesign page layouts on src/pages/*.astro: big headings, clear sections with rigid spacing and borders
   - Ensure consistent header and footer across all pages using brutalist style
   - Adjust cards and CTA styles to reflect brutalism and authority

3. Pages Redesign
   - Homepage (index.astro): Redesign hero, services overview, and CTAs with new styling and structure

   - Products (products.astro): Align product categories and partner CTA to new theme
   - New OPSEC Principles Page (src/pages/opsec-principles.astro): Create page explaining key OPSEC principles with brutalist design

4. Content Review and Update
   - Review all existing content during layout redesign and update for clarity and authoritativeness
   - Use bold, concise text with clear hierarchy

5. Testing
